# What is DECODE function in SQL?

In Oracle, DECODE function allows us to add procedural if-then-else logic to the query. DECODE compares the expression to each search value one by one. If expression is equal to a search, then the corresponding result is returned by the Oracle Database. If a match is not found, then default is returned. If default is omitted, then Oracle returns null.
